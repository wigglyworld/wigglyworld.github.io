<p class="meta">04 Dec 2013 - Seattle</p>

Today's assignment was to create a blog that programmers will actually use.  Make it cheap, stylable, customizable and store the posts on GitHub so 
they wont get lost.

### What are GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages are public webpages freely hosted and easily published through the GitHub site.

### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator". It is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to 
build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, **markdown**, etc.

### Omit needless things

The staff at WigglyWorld LLC appreciate the zen of minimilism.  Minimilism is often easier to like
than to live but here is an exception and the links to get started:

* [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/)
* [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
* [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)
* [Full Featured Guide](http://erjjones.github.io/blog/How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day/)
* [Minimalist Model](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io/)

### Conclusion

Install Ruby and Jekyll. Get Jekyll working locally and build your blog.  After you get your site working locally push your code to
USERNAME.github.io repository and it will just work.
